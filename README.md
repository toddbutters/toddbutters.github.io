Hi. 

I created this Github account and page to host my resume.

I did not want to use a typical word processor to create or update my resume again so I am switching
to Markdown for simplicity and version control, and using Pandoc to convert it to HTML and PDF.

I may add other repos in the future, but for now it is just my resume. 

Feel free to contact me with any questions.

Thanks for stopping by. 

Cheers,

Todd
